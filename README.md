We will go over the game per folder.

<!---## OneLife_vXX/animations--->
## OneLife_vXX/categories
This folder houses categorie files.   
A categorie has the following attributes

| variable name | description |
| --- | --- |
| parentID    | parent ID |
| numObjects  | number of Objects |
| [nameless]  | multiple child Ids |

parentID and ChildId are also the ids of objects.  

Child objects can be used in transitions which require the parent object.
### Example
file name: 367.txt
```
parentID=367
numObjects=12
132
131
66
64
67
68
69

Objects can be used in transistions to create other objects

This folder houses object files.   
There are diffrent kind of transistion files.

### Transitions may use between 3 and 11 variables
The first two variables always come from the filename, and the other 1-9 variables are parsed according to this pattern:
%d %d %d %f %f %d %d %d %d

| place | variable name | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first variable in file name | actor | required object 1 |
| second variable in file name  | target | required object 2 |
| first variable in file  | newActor | result object 1 |
| second variable in file  | newTarget | result object 2 |
| third variable in file  | autoDecaySeconds | time in seconds |
| fourth variable in file  | actorMinUseFraction |   |
| fifth variable in file  | targetMinUseFraction |   |
| sixth variable in file  | reverseUseActorFlag |   |
| seventh variable in file  | reverseUseTargetFlag |   |
| eigth variable in file  | move |   |
| ninth variable in file  | desiredMoveDist |   |

### With L in the name
Old format, alias for LT
### With LT in the name
I don't know
"Last use of target"
### With LA in the name
I don't know
"Last use of Actor"

## Algorithm for recipe calculator

I have made a algorithm which uses the transition file to create a tree of transitions.
The algorithm starts by assigning each object a step(called recipeTier in code).
Step 0 is the once we find in nature. Step 1 is the items we can create with step 0. Step 2 builds on that.
This should be done before hand.

Generation of the tree
1. Receive an object id
2. Find all the transitions which create the object
3. Find the transitions which has the lowest variable for max(required1->step,required2->step)
4. Save the transition in a global variable
5. Do step 5 for both required objects
6. If the step is higher then 1 go to 1.
7. You will now have all the tranistions relate to the object id.
